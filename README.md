# Mealplanner

A program to help plan meals from a fixed database of recipes and constraints.

- Our repetoire of meals consists of about 40 recipes.  
- Some days we have limited time to prepare meals, so we want to choose simple recipes or meals that can be cooked in a slow cooker.  
- Some recipes produce copious leftovers
